# Common Verilog source for an RV32I processor

Sail-RV32I-common is a small RISC-V processor core used as the baseline in teaching. These files are also currently used by [Narvie](https://github.com/physical-computation/narvie) for it's processor.

## Tests
The verilog modules have a (non-comprehensive) test suite which can be run using [iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/).
